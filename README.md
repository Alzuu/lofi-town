Hello reader! ðŸ‘‹ If you're wondering what this repo is about, it is a personal development project of a lofi player application. The purpose of this repo is to practice development with Vue 3 Composition API, as well as create something that is personally meaningful and fun to me.

## Installation
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and installed, any newer version should work fine (I use v18.12.0).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alzuu/lofi-town.git
```

2. Go to repository and install dependencies:

3. Create a dotenv file for GIPHY API key

4. Open the dotenv file and add the GIPHY API key as `VITE_GIPHY_KEY={your_key}`
After that you've finished the installation!
